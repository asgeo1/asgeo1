### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adam George, a freelance software developer from Melbourne, Australia.

I've been working as a software developer since 2002. In that time I've worked in many different industries - energy, transport, digital design, eCommerce.

I've worked for large companies, and I've worked for startups, I've also worked for small businesses and individuals wanting to get a project off the ground.

I'm capable of managing an entire project end-to-end; requirements, analysis, design - through to building, testing, deploying and support.

Or I'm available to just concentrate on single thing - say a mobile app, or backend API.
